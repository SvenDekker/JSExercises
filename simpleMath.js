// Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the
// sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as
// shown in the example output:

let number1 = prompt('What is the first number? ')
let number2 = prompt('What is the second number? ')
prompt(`${number1} + ${number2} = ${number1 + number2}`)
prompt(`${number1} - ${number2} = ${number1 - number2}`)
prompt(`${number1} / ${number2} = ${number1 / number2}`)
prompt(`${number1} * ${number2} = ${number1 * number2}`)
